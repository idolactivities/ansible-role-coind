  # Intentionally configure bitcoind to connect to an invalid node so that
  # coind does not consume bandwidth to sync the block database. This is
  # mainly to prevent developers on Comcast (and other ISPs with bandwidth
  # limits) from hitting their bandwidth cap accidentally.
  #
  # Comment this line out if you intend to use this Vagrantfile for
  # integration testing with other software.  For the purposes of testing
  # this role itself, we don't really need to download the block database,
  # thus this artificial handicap should be fine for most.
